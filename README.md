# Papyrus Hunting

This repository contains code written for a school project focused on data analysis. In this repo, you'll find an application that allows you to gather data on papyri from various places and times in antiquity. This data was automatically retrieved from the [Trismegistos collection](https://www.trismegistos.org/). All data can be found in the `data` directory, and scripts used for analysis and scraping are in the `scripts` directory.

### 1. Recherche de papyrus

In this mode, you can specify a location and a date interval and choose from the resulting documents. Once you select a papyrus, you'll have access to more precise information about the date of writing and the provenance, as well as a listing (when available) of the characters and places mentioned in the text.

You will also find the content of the text with annotations regarding specific writing choices. This feature allows you to see how a word is written in the text and how it should normally be written in ancient Greek.
